def: "A protein complex that interacts with the carboxy-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II and plays an active role in transducing the signal from a transcription factor to the transcriptional machinery. The core mediator complex has a stimulatory effect on basal transcription, and contains most of the same subdomains as the larger form of mediator complex -- a head domain comprising proteins known in Saccharomyces as Srb2, -4, and -5, Med6, -8, and -11, and Rox3 proteins; a middle domain comprising Med1, -4, and -7, Nut1 and -2, Cse2, Rgr1, Soh1, and Srb7 proteins; and a tail consisting of Gal11p, Med2p, Pgd1p, and Sin4p -- but lacks the regulatory subcomplex comprising Ssn2, -3, and -8, and Srb8 proteins. Metazoan core mediator complexes have similar modular structures and include homologs of yeast Srb and Med proteins." [PMID:11454195, PMID:16168358, PMID:17870225]
