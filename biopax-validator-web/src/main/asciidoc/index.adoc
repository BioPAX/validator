= Introduction

The Suggester service will check and recommended values for a BioPAX property in a given context.
Currently, it's an experimental feature of the online BioPAX Validator service and can only advise about Xrefs.

== Get the Identifiers.org URI for a biological entity/entry by the data collection name (db) and identifier (id).

Example request:

include::{snippets}/should-return-uri/curl-request.adoc[]

HTTP response:

include::{snippets}/should-return-uri/http-response.adoc[]

== Check the list of biological xrefs and suggests preferred name, uri, namespace, etc. where possible.

Example request:

include::{snippets}/should-return-checked-xrefs/curl-request.adoc[]

HTTP response:

include::{snippets}/should-return-checked-xrefs/http-response.adoc[]
